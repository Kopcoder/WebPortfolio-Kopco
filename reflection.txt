In terms of rhetoric struggles, I had difficulty selecting a color scheme to
correctly complement the intended message. Since the rhetoric of this project is
largely hypothetical, I had to remove myself from the efficiency that I would
normally focus on as a computer science and focus on more design elements than
I normally would. I chose a serif font and organized the elements of the website
in a more visually appealing way rather than keeping the site purely organized
and efficient like I normally would.

When it came to technological struggles, most of these came in the form of
learning HTML and CSS. The process of learning the organization and syntax of
HTML was very familiar, since it was very similar to the process of learning
other programming languages like Python or Java. CSS on the other hand was a bit
more unfamiliar. I have not dealt with user interfaces very often, so learning
this was difficult but will likely prove to be quite useful.
