This web portfolio is designed to be a hypothetical job-seeking website using
my soundscape narrative and visual argument that I would use if I were to be
going into the design field. The intended audience for this portfolio is
employers looking for employees who have interacted with the software involved
in putting together these pieces of media as well as further proficiency in
GitHub and the adjacent software. The media itself is present on the site, but
the primary goal is to use that media to convince this audience that I am
capable of using this software for future projects, and the sorts of tools
within that software that I was able to implement in these projects
specifically. The site is meant to convey not only a basic experience with the
software involved, but a willingness to learn and experience more with time and
future projects.
