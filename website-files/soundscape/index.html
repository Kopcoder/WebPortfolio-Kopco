          This soundscape project was built to tell a story to any who listened to it.
          While the piece contains the structure of a story, with a rising action, a
          climax, and a resolution, the story is not spoon-fed to the listener. The
          soundscape wordlessly gives structure to the story that the listener wants to
          hear. The structure and title guide the listener towards considering a story of
          pursuit, but who is being pursued? What are they being pursued by? These are
          questions for the listener to answer as they experience the sound.
        </p>

          Effects such as "Fade In" and "Fade Out" were used to transition between
          different clips in an attempt to make it seem like one continuous track so as to
          keep the listener engaged without reminding them that they're listening to an
          edited piece of audio. The effect "Reverb" was primarily utilized in the
          simulation of cave sounds in the piece to give a feeling of space to that moment
          in the story. Many clips were altered by the "Amplify" effect in an attempt to
          balance the audio as well as simulate the approach of whatever was cracking the
          sticks by causing those clips to get louder and softer as the pursuer passed the
          protagonist and continued on. Samples from many clips were cut up and fit
          together in differing ways, occasionally joining the clip boundaries to assist
          in the movement of the sounds together, but otherwise left separate in order to
          facilitate minor adjustments in timing between them.

          Much of what I faced artistically in the realm of challenges was finding a
          balance between allowing the listener of my soundscape to form their own story
          while listening, while also giving them enough of a structure to help build that
          story without explicitly telling them. I struggled with giving the pursuer a
          growling noise in its pursuit, but ultimately decided against it to leave the
          chase as more of a mystery for the listener to solve. I considered using words
          at times to guide the listener into picturing the “protagonist” ducking and
          hiding into a cave, but decided that reverb could help achieve that implicitly
          without directly telling the listener that’s what was happening.

          Technologically, I was already a bit familiar with Audacity, but had a few
          learning experiences. I hadn’t initially known that the fading effects faded the
          selected section, so many of my early fades spanned the entire track before I
          learned of that aspect of the effect and returned to fix them. I struggled a bit
          with the “amplify” effect in that I thought that the slider was set by default
          exactly where the gain was at that point. I thought that moving the slider to
          the left a slight bit would turn the volume down, but it was increasing the
          volume instead. I later learned that in order to use amplify to decrease volume,
          the slider needed to be dragged into the negatives, and returned to the other
          tracks that I had amplified in order to quiet them down. Otherwise, I considered
          recording some of my own audio, but ultimately decided that with the equipment I
          had available (my phone) for the sort of recording I would have to do to
          contribute to this piece (general outdoor noises), I wouldn't have nearly the
          sound quality of the sounds I found without too much difficulty on freesound to
          fulfill their purpose. I found that if I were to use sounds recorded on my
          phone, the deficit in sound quality between my own tracks and the tracks that
          other’s recorded would become salient in the listener.
