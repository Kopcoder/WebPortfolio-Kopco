    <p>
      This visual argument serves as a light hearted satirical take on the
      anti-vaccination movement. It serves to hyperbolize the arguments into the realm
      of absurdity using a (hopefully) fictional argument about vaccines being as
      simple as injecting a sneeze directly into the body. It serves to express a
      misinformed voice in a humorous light.

      A struggle that I had with developing and composing the rhetoric of this visual
      argument was defining a hard line of absurdity. Many genuine arguments against
      vaccination border the realms of absurdity, so clearly defining my piece as
      satirical became a difficult question of "Just what is unquestionable absurdity
      within this context?" I used very clashing visuals such as clashing colors,
      glaring font choices, and just all around immature tone in an attempt to achieve
      that absurdity, but it still didn't seem to be quite obvious enough. I
      determined through the help of classroom critique that framing the piece as a
      stance of a fictional group on Facebook would assist in defining this as
      absurdity. I created a fictional Facebook group called: "Brainy Mommas Against
      Vaccination and Also Children" to be the supposed source of this fictional
      argument and placed that name in a call to action at the bottom of the argument.
      With a name that implies that the group of mothers are against children,
      hopefully the absurdity of the rest of the piece and its satirical intent become
      apparent.

      In the realm of technological struggles, there were many learning experiences
      while using GIMP. I used most of the different selection tools available in the
      program while working on the piece, I used the cropping tools to keep the images
      at a concise size and/or remove the background to make it transparent and flow
      with the rest of the piece more gracefully, I dealt with the layers with
      duplication and organization to help build the argument, and I used text tools
      alongside the rest of that (primarily the duplicate and merge layers features)
      to achieve the drop shadow effect behind the text. I used the flip tool to
      direct the faces in the images toward the center to draw the audience's
      attention inward. I also used the gradient effect for the background and
      installed an external arrow macro in order to draw the green arrows
      consistently, because GIMP does not have an arrow shape built in by default.
